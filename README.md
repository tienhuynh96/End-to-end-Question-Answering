There are two parts on End-to-End-Question-Answering project:
- Document retriever: Retrieve equivalent document with the question.
- Document Reader: Read document and raise the answer for question.

  + Some type of reader for reference (demo code):
      * Classification Approach:
        - Demo code (LSTM-based): Question-Answering Classification Approach.ipynb
      * Extractive Approach:
        - Demo code (LSTM-based): Question-Answering Extractive Approach-LSTM-based.ipynb
        - Demo code (Transformer-based): Question-Answering Extractive Approach-Transformer-based.ipynb
        - Demo code (LSTM-based) and dataset is SQuAD Dataset: Question-Answering Extractive Approach-LSTM-based - SQuAD Dataset.ipynb
